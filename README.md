# Project: Using Bootstrap

In this project, I got a chance to try out Twitter‚Äôs Bootstrap framework by building a site that actually uses it ‚Äì Newsweek.

The project had the ojective of learning the structure, elements and fuctions of Bootstrap and then use them to set up the responsive layout of a website and cloning the Newsweek website.

With a mobile first approach I was able to set up the main sections and their responsive changes to different viewport sizes also I was able to mimic all the changes that each section had with every change of the viewport.
